    <h1><strong>Little Butterfly</strong></h1>
    <h2><i>by Amy Farquhar</i></h2>
    <p>
    I lived my life inside you <br>
    For nine months, safe and sound <br>
    Cocooned in all your love<br>
    So mama, papa, please don't cry<br>
    I'm still with you, just up above<br>
    </p>
    <p> 
    I felt your every heartbeat<br>
    It's my sweetest melody<br>
    And for every heavenly bedtime<br>
    The Angels play it back to me <br>
    </p>
    <p> 
    I know how much that I am wanted<br>
    I feel so very blessed<br>
    Of all the mummy's in all the world<br>
    I got the very best!<br>
    </p>
    <p>
    You think of me in all your waking hours,<br>
    And on those sleepless nights<br>
    Just look out the window and you'll find me<br>
    The brightest star, the most dazzling light<br>
    </p>
    <p> 
    I'm that little breeze in the summer<br>
    And I'm that unexpected white feather<br>
    I plucked it from my downy wings<br>
    So that you remember we are always together<br>
    </p>
    <p>
    I know how much It hurt your soul<br>
    When we had to say goodbye<br>
    But I'm not gone, in always here<br>
    Im your sweet little butterfly.<br>
